# CS-Library-Classification-System

## Summary

I needed a method to organize my various computer books, nothing I know of or was able to search for works. The general classification systems are too vague to be of practical use because of how intertwined everything is.
This system is based on the [Colon Classification System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_classification) out from India, but with changes tailored to CS. Due to it's focus on symbols this should be able to be adapted
easily across various languages.

## Definition
This is a speacialised version of the Colon Classification based on the information presenting within the wikipedia article as of 1:19 PM 3/5/2024.
This is designed only for computer science related information to be cataloged and is not general purpose.
